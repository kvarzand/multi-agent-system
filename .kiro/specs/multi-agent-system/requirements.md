# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a multi-agent system composed of multiple agent gateways, agents, and tools. The system will enable distributed agent orchestration, communication, and tool execution across different components to handle complex workflows and tasks.

## Glossary

- **Multi-Agent System**: A distributed system composed of multiple autonomous agents that can communicate and collaborate across enterprise divisions
- **Enterprise Division**: A business unit or organizational division within the enterprise that operates its own agent gateway
- **Division Gateway**: An Agent Gateway instance dedicated to serving a specific enterprise division
- **Agent Gateway**: A service that acts as an entry point and router for agent requests and communications within or across divisions
- **Agent**: An autonomous software component that can perform tasks, make decisions, and communicate with other agents, discoverable across the enterprise
- **Tool**: A functional component that agents can invoke to perform specific operations or access external resources
- **Enterprise Agent Registry**: A centralized service that maintains information about all agents across enterprise divisions and their capabilities
- **Division Agent Registry**: A local registry within each division that manages division-specific agents
- **Message Router**: A component responsible for routing messages between agents and gateways within and across divisions
- **Tool Registry**: A service that manages available tools and their interfaces
- **Cross-Division Discovery**: The capability for agents in one division to discover and utilize agents from other divisions

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an enterprise administrator, I want each enterprise division to have its own dedicated gateway, so that divisions can manage their own agents while participating in the broader enterprise ecosystem.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Multi-Agent System SHALL support deployment of one Division Gateway per Enterprise Division
2. WHEN a Division Gateway receives a request, THE Multi-Agent System SHALL route the request to an appropriate Agent within that division or across divisions
3. THE Multi-Agent System SHALL maintain an Enterprise Agent Registry that tracks agents across all divisions
4. WHEN a Division Gateway becomes unavailable, THE Multi-Agent System SHALL provide failover mechanisms to maintain agent accessibility
5. THE Multi-Agent System SHALL enable each Enterprise Division to configure and manage its own Division Gateway independently

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want agents to discover and communicate with agents across all enterprise divisions, so that complex cross-divisional workflows can be executed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an Agent needs to discover available agents, THE Enterprise Agent Registry SHALL return agents from all divisions that match the search criteria
2. WHEN an Agent communicates with another Agent in a different division, THE Multi-Agent System SHALL route the message through the appropriate Division Gateways
3. THE Multi-Agent System SHALL support both synchronous and asynchronous communication between agents across divisions
4. WHEN an Agent sends a cross-division message, THE Message Router SHALL deliver it to the target Agent within 10 seconds
5. THE Multi-Agent System SHALL maintain audit trails for all cross-division agent communications

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an agent developer, I want agents to discover and invoke available tools, so that agents can perform specialized operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Multi-Agent System SHALL maintain a Tool Registry with all available tools and their interfaces
2. WHEN an Agent queries for tools, THE Tool Registry SHALL return a list of available tools matching the query criteria
3. WHEN an Agent invokes a tool, THE Multi-Agent System SHALL execute the tool and return results within the specified timeout
4. THE Multi-Agent System SHALL support tool versioning and backward compatibility
5. IF a tool execution fails, THEN THE Multi-Agent System SHALL return a structured error response to the requesting Agent

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want to monitor agent activities and system health, so that I can ensure reliable operation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Multi-Agent System SHALL log all agent communications and tool invocations
2. THE Multi-Agent System SHALL provide health check endpoints for all gateways and agents
3. WHEN system metrics exceed defined thresholds, THE Multi-Agent System SHALL generate alerts
4. THE Multi-Agent System SHALL track and report agent performance metrics including response times and success rates
5. THE Multi-Agent System SHALL provide a dashboard showing real-time system status and agent activities

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want to control agent access and permissions, so that the system operates securely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Multi-Agent System SHALL authenticate all agents before allowing system access
2. THE Multi-Agent System SHALL authorize agent actions based on configured permissions
3. WHEN an Agent attempts unauthorized access, THE Multi-Agent System SHALL deny the request and log the attempt
4. THE Multi-Agent System SHALL encrypt all inter-agent communications
5. THE Multi-Agent System SHALL support role-based access control for different agent types

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a division manager, I want to share my division's agents with other divisions while maintaining control over access, so that the enterprise can leverage specialized capabilities across organizational boundaries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Multi-Agent System SHALL allow each Enterprise Division to configure which agents are shareable across divisions
2. WHEN an Agent is marked as shareable, THE Enterprise Agent Registry SHALL make it discoverable to agents in other divisions
3. THE Multi-Agent System SHALL enforce division-level permissions for cross-division agent access
4. WHEN a cross-division agent request is made, THE Division Gateway SHALL validate permissions before allowing access
5. THE Multi-Agent System SHALL provide usage analytics for shared agents to division managers
